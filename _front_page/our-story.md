# We met at Big Blue...

Jen and Jake met each other while working at IBM. After several months of getting to know each other as friends, Jake finally got the courage to ask Jen out on a real date on February 12th, 2015. They went to a rock show at a local, Lowell bar the next day (Friday the 13th), and it has been a loving adventure ever since.
